            <p> <br> PlotWeb is an app designed to help writers organize their characters and visualize relationships between them. <br>
                On the left is MVP 1, which my team and I developed and debugged using the Flutter SDK, transforming our idea into a functional application.
                Beyond coding, we followed the entire product life cycle, ensuring a structured and well-rounded development process.

                    Research
                    To ensure our project aligned with the needs of creative writers, our team conducted research by engaging directly with them. 
                    We asked what aspects of the writing process they found most challenging and what could be automated without compromising content or creativity. 
                    The most common challenge they highlighted was avoiding plot holes and maintaining a cohesive plot structure.

                <p> <br>
                    My team an I developed a Flutter-based app that combines local data storage and dynamic graph visualization to help users 
                    manage and explore character relationships. Using SQLite with the sqflite package, we implemented a structured database 
                    to store character data and connections, ensuring efficient data retrieval and persistence. We leveraged Provider for 
                    state management and integrated GraphView to create an interactive, visual representation of relationships. Additionally, 
                    we incorporated multi_select_flutter to enhance user input. This project showcases my skills in mobile development, database 
                    management, and UI design while allowing me to explore creative problem-solving in app development. <br> <br>

                <p>
                    We met up with the Creative writing club to download the app onto their phones and test for a week. We asked them to 
                    email us with any bugs or features they would like to see added.
